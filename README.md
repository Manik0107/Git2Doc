# Code2Doc
Code-to-Documentation Generator is an automated tool that analyzes source code using static analysis and AST parsing to generate structured, human-readable documentation. It extracts functions, classes, dependencies, and comments, producing accurate Markdown, HTML, or JSON docs that stay aligned with the codebase.
